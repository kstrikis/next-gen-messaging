# Technical Decisions

This document outlines the key technical decisions made for the ChatGenius project and the reasoning behind them.

## Frontend

### React 18 vs 19
- Currently using React 18.2.0 instead of React 19
- Main reason: Auth0 React SDK compatibility (only supports up to React 18)
- Will upgrade once Auth0 adds React 19 support

### Next.js 15
- Using the latest version (15.1.4)
- Provides improved performance and features
- Compatible with React 18
- Includes built-in optimizations for static and server-side rendering

### UI Components
- **Tailwind CSS**: Chosen for utility-first approach and excellent developer experience
- **shadcn/ui**: Selected for:
  - High-quality, accessible components
  - Built on Radix UI primitives
  - Easy customization with Tailwind
  - No vendor lock-in (components are copied into the project)

### State Management
- **Redux Toolkit**: Chosen for:
  - Simplified Redux setup
  - Built-in immutability with Immer
  - Reduced boilerplate
  - TypeScript support
- **Redux Persist**: Added for state persistence across sessions
- **React Query**: Used for server state management and caching

## Backend

### Node.js & Express
- Using Node.js for JavaScript/ECMAScript consistency across the stack
- Express.js for its:
  - Minimal, unopinionated framework
  - Large ecosystem
  - Easy middleware integration
  - Excellent performance

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Selected for:
  - ACID compliance
  - Rich feature set
  - Excellent performance
  - Strong community support
- **Prisma**: Chosen as ORM for:
  - Type safety
  - Auto-generated migrations
  - Excellent developer experience
  - Built-in connection pooling

### Real-time Communication
- **Socket.IO**: Selected for:
  - WebSocket support with fallbacks
  - Room/namespace support
  - Built-in reconnection logic
  - Broadcasting capabilities

## Testing

### Multiple Testing Layers
- **Jest**: Unit testing
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing
- **SuperTest**: API testing
- **Cypress**: End-to-end testing
- **Storybook**: Component development and visual testing

## Code Quality

### ESLint & Prettier
- ESLint v9 with Airbnb config for consistent code style
- Prettier for automatic code formatting
- Configured to work together without conflicts

### Version Control & CI
- Git for version control
- Husky for Git hooks
- GitHub Actions planned for CI/CD

## Security

### Authentication
- **Auth0**: Chosen for:
  - Robust security features
  - Social login support
  - JWT handling
  - MFA support
  - Enterprise features

### API Security
- **Helmet**: Security headers
- **CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- Environment variables for sensitive data

## Future Considerations

1. **React 19 Upgrade**
   - Monitor Auth0 React SDK for React 19 support
   - Plan upgrade when compatibility is confirmed

2. **Database Scaling**
   - Consider connection pooling optimization
   - Plan for read replicas if needed
   - Evaluate caching strategies

3. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Implement comprehensive logging strategy
   - Set up monitoring and alerting
   - Consider APM solutions

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement code splitting
   - Add service worker for offline support
   - Optimize asset delivery
