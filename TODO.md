# **Updated TODO List for Developing a Slack-like Messaging Application with AI Features**

---

**Project Overview:**

Develop a production-ready messaging application aiming for feature parity with Slack, followed by the integration of AI-powered features. Development will be performed using Cursor with Claude Sonnet 3.5, and deployment will be on AWS services. Strict UI/UX planning and instructions will be followed to ensure excellent usability. The project will employ test-driven development (TDD), using only JavaScript, adhering to Airbnb code conventions, and utilizing ESLint for code quality.

- [ ] **Establish Git Workflow**
  - Enforce one branch per feature/task.
  - Require pull requests for merging into the main branch.
  - Implement branch protection rules to prevent direct commits to the main branch.
- [ ] **Set Up Git Hooks**
  - Use tools like **Husky** to add pre-commit and pre-push hooks.
  - Ensure tests and linters run before commits and pushes.

### **2. Select and Document Technology Stack**

- [ ] **Frontend Stack**
  - **React.js** for building user interfaces.
  - **Next.js** for server-side rendering and routing.
- [ ] **Backend Stack**

## **Critical Considerations**

### **Testing Benefits and Execution Plan**

- **Immediate Feedback**
  - Tests provide immediate validation that code changes meet requirements.
  - Early detection of bugs reduces the cost and time to fix them.
- **When to Write Tests**
  - **Before Implementation**: Write unit and integration tests before writing code (TDD).
  - **During Development**: Continuously run tests during development to catch issues early.
  - **After Feature Completion**: Run the full test suite, including E2E tests, to ensure feature integrity.
- **Running Tests**
  - **Unit Tests**: Fast and run on every save or commit.
  - **Integration Tests**: Run after unit tests pass.
  - **E2E Tests**: Run headless in Cypress; critical for simulating real user interactions.

### **Headless Testing with Cypress**

- **Importance**
  - Provides insights into client-server interactions.
  - Helps catch UI bugs and synchronization issues.
- **Configuration**
  - Set up scripts to run Cypress tests in headless mode.
  - Collect server errors, logs, and client data for analysis.

### **Code Conventions and Linting**

- **Airbnb Style Guide**
  - Ensures code is clean, consistent, and maintainable.
- **ESLint**
  - Automatically detect and fix linting errors.
  - Enforce code conventions before commits.

## **Concluding Notes**

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
  - Central to the development process.
  - Ensures each piece of functionality is validated.
- **Documentation is Continuous**
  - Not relegated to the end; updated alongside code.
  - Critical for LLM's ability to parse and understand the project.
- **LLM Integration**
  - LLM must be guided with clear, machine-parsable instructions.
  - Knowledge base and documentation are essential for context management.
- **Project Integrity**
  - Through TDD, consistent code conventions, and immediate feedback, we maintain high code quality.
  - This approach supports rapid development without sacrificing robustness.
